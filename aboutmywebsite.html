<h3>About My web site</h3>
<Article>
I went for a walk just now before my lecture with Roman, starts. I walked along Lampton Quay 
a little way , then turned left and walked two blocks to the waterfront. I then turned right
and walked along to Sir Frank Kitts park which has a bridge accross to conect to the city council 
precinct. I crossed the bridge and along onto Willis Street, turned right, walked north and onto 
Lampton Quay and back to the campus. Beautiful early spring day!
